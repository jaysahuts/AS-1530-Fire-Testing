# AS 1530 FIRE TESTING – ENGINEER REPOSITORY

Owner: Jay Sah  
Role Focus: Site Engineer | Senior Project Engineer | PCA / Fire Coordination  
Project Type: High-rise Residential, Mixed-use, Fit-out  

---

## 1. OVERVIEW
This repository is a structured knowledge base for understanding, applying, and checking compliance with the AS 1530 series of fire testing standards on high-rise residential and mixed-use projects.

It is intended for use by site engineers, project engineers, and consultants involved in fire compliance, inspections, approvals, and coordination with PCA and fire engineers.

---

## 2. AS 1530 SERIES – PURPOSE
The AS 1530 series defines methods for fire testing of building materials, components, and structures.  
It is used to demonstrate compliance with NCC Volume One fire safety requirements.

Key distinction:
- Reaction-to-fire tests: AS 1530.1, AS 1530.3
- Fire-resistance tests (FRL): AS 1530.4

---

## 3. AS 1530.1 – COMBUSTIBILITY
Standard: AS 1530.1:2024  
Purpose: Determination of combustibility of materials

### Typical Applications
- Façade materials
- Insulation (EPS, PIR, mineral wool)
- Cladding backing boards
- Fire collars and wraps (material assessment)

### Key Test Outcomes
- Sustained flaming duration
- Furnace temperature rise limits
- Classification as non-combustible

### Site Engineer Checks
- Product tested matches product installed
- Thickness and density match test report
- Any coating, laminate, or facing included in test
- Test report edition is current

---

## 4. AS 1530.2 – IGNITABILITY
Standard: AS 1530.2:1993  
Purpose: Assessment of ignitability

### Notes
- Rarely used in modern projects
- May appear in legacy approvals
- Usually replaced by AS 1530.3 for linings

### Site Engineer Checks
- Confirm if explicitly required by approval
- Do not assume compliance without a report

---

## 5. AS/NZS 1530.3 – FLAME, HEAT AND SMOKE
Standard: AS/NZS 1530.3:1999  
Purpose: Fire behaviour of wall and ceiling linings

### Test Indices
- Ignitability Index
- Spread of Flame Index
- Heat Evolved Index
- Smoke Developed Index

### Typical Locations
- Apartments
- Fire stairs
- Lobbies
- Corridors
- Fit-out areas

### Site Engineer Checks
- Indices comply with NCC limits
- Mounting method matches site installation
- Painted or unpainted condition matches test
- Backing material included in test

---

## 6. AS 1530.4 – FIRE RESISTANCE (FRL)
Standard: AS 1530.4:2014 (Reconfirmed 2025)  
Purpose: Fire-resistance testing of building elements

### Elements Tested
- Walls
- Floors
- Columns
- Beams
- Doorsets
- Service penetrations
- Dampers

### Fire Resistance Level (FRL)
- Structural adequacy
- Integrity
- Insulation

### Site Engineer Checks
- FRL matches drawings exactly
- Tested configuration matches site construction
- Penetration systems approved and installed correctly
- Loadbearing or non-loadbearing condition correct
- Supporting construction included in test

---

## 7. NCC VOLUME ONE MAPPING
Relevant NCC provisions include:
- C1D – Fire resistance
- C2D – Compartmentation
- Specification C1.9
- Façade fire spread controls
- Service penetration and fire stopping requirements

---

## 8. SITE INSPECTION FOCUS AREAS
- Fire walls and shafts
- Service penetrations and fire collars
- Fire doors and hardware installation
- Fire stopping continuity
- Compliance labels and tags
- Photographic evidence for approvals

---

## 9. COMMON SITE NON-COMPLIANCES
- Incorrect insulation substituted
- Unsealed or incomplete service penetrations
- Coatings applied after testing
- Missing fire stopping
- Test report does not match drawings or installation

---

## 10. APPROVALS AND RECORDS
Maintain and track:
- AS 1530 test reports
- Engineering judgments
- Fire engineer approvals
- PCA conditions
- Variations register

---

## 11. QUICK REFERENCE NOTES
- AS 1530.1 vs AS 1530.3
- Reaction-to-fire vs Fire-resistance
- Common PCA questions
- Typical fire-related defects on site

---

## 12. LEARNING LOG
Record:
- Site lessons learned
- PCA and authority comments
- Fire engineer feedback
- Improvements for future projects
